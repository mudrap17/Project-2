# Project-2
Speech Emotion Recognition 

Through analyzing the tone and pitch of voice, we attempt to recognize the emotion of a human speech through this project.

We use the RAVDESS dataset available at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWsrN2Ep7x6lWqOXfr4rpKGYrJhWc8z7/view

We use the Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier model for training after extracting the features for the set of emotions and find out the accuracy of the model.
